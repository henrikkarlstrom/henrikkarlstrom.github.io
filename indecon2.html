		<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
		<p>Since the 1990s, most European countries have undergone some degree of liberalization of 
		their electricity infrastructures. This has meant exposing parts of the energy sector, 
		such as power generation, to competitive entry, while keeping its other parts, such as 
		electricity grids, intact as regional monopolies operating alongside liberalised energy markets. 
		Inspired by earlier studies on economisation and valuative regimes, this paper investigates the 
		consequences of this transition, using the Norwegian case as an example. We argue that the 
		transition does not constitute economisation in the traditional sense because vital parts of the 
		grid sector remained publicly regulated monopolies. Instead, we find the transition included a 
		shift in governing logic from one soundly rooted in engineering and controlled by elected politicians 
		to one influenced chiefly by economics and controlled by complex calculative regimes in which elected 
		officials are studiously hands-off. We argue this constitutes a form of indirect economization. 
		This process of indirect economisation has had obvious implications for the degree of democratic 
		control over vital societal infrastructure. Thus, we argue that processes of indirect economisation, 
		sure to be found working elsewhere as well, should be studied alongside general economisation in 
		order to grasp clearer their implication in modern, liberal societies.

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>This articles seeks to shed light on the role of economic calculative 
		techniques in the regulation of important societal functions in a modern market-based political economy. 
		We study what kind of mathematical formulas and numbers underpin these techniques, 
		and their changes in recent times. To these ends, we utilise recent concepts from the 
		fields of social studies of markets and valuation studies. We exemplify them by the case of 
		changing regulatory regimes for the income of electricity grid companies in Norway, 
		comparing the current market-based system to the previous regime of total state control over 
		the electricity sector from production to delivery via the grid.
		</p>

		<p>Liberalised energy infrastructures have become the norm throughout Europe in recent decades. 
		This has mostly come about through a transition from a centrally planned, state controlled energy 
		sector to a division between regional distribution monopolies operating alongside competitive suppliers. 
		We investigate this transition in the Norwegian context. Focusing on the grid sector we discuss the 
		implications of transforming the ruling logic of the sector from one grounded in infrastructural and 
		technological development to one of complex, bureaucratic calculative techniques in service of 
		optimizing the status quo.
		</p>
		
		<p>These questions are not just of academic interest. They form part of a political discussion 
		about how to govern an increasingly complex society in an acceptably democratic way. As Rowland and Passoth 
		point out in a review of recent literature on infrastructure and the state, studying «state <i>through</i> 
		infrastructure and the state <i>in</i> infrastructure» (Rowland and Passoth 2015, emphasis in original)

		is a crucial part in understanding how decisions that affect broad swathes of society are structured. 
		Of course, this also has political implications: «to be political in this era is to raise questions about 
		how the state works» (Guldi 2012:3)

		have called for studies of what they call economisation, looking at how ever more aspects of society become the object 
		of economic logics and fall under the purview of the field of economics. They mostly focus on how new areas 
		of life become governed by market mechanisms, so-called marketisation, but they also discuss how the logic of 
		competition and the tools, concepts and materials of economics render a phenomenon that used to be seen as 
		outside the grasp of the market as ‘economic’. Following this, (Breslau 2013

		has used economisation theory to analyse the construction of what he calls market-like entities, 
		parts of the electricity infrastructure of the US that is now being subjected to pseudo-competition and 
		financialisation in order to attain the appearance of a competitive market. (Karlstrøm 2012)

		have shown how similar processes have been going on in Norway and Finland respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p>However, there are sectors of society that are not being turned into such market-like entities. With previously integrated societal functions such as infrastructure maintenance becoming separated into market-exposed companies and ‘natural monopolies’, the latter are finding themselves governed by a new set of financial regulations. This is happening even when - according to the original intention - these parts of infrastructures were not supposed to be subjected to market competition and hence efficiency gains. This is certainly a form of economisation, although not in the direct sense of Çaliskan and Callon. Rather, it might be called indirect economisation. Our claim is that the indirect way in which such economisation processes happens has consequences for our understanding of the room for democratic control over vital societal infrastructure.
		</p>
		
		<p>In the upcoming sections we further elaborate the concept of economisation and valuation theory to understand the methods by which economisation has been carried out. We then provide the background of the Norwegian electricity grid regulation regime and an overview over how the governing logic of this system has changed considerably after the introduction of the market liberalisation and the separation of grid operation into natural monopolies. This is intended as a concrete example of how indirect economisation poses some interesting quandaries for the governance of infrastructure and other important societal sectors in modern market society. We argue that this transition to a system of indirect economisation has an impact on the possibilities for transparency in a process that ultimately decides a large part of the costs to end users of having a functional infrastructure that supports almost all aspects of everyday life.

      <h3>Sections</h3>
      <p>Organize your document with an <span class="code">article</span> element inside your <span class="code">body</span> tag. Inside that, use <span class="code">section</span> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>

      <h3>Headings</h3>
      <p>Envisioned CSS uses <span class="code">h1</span> for the page title, <span class="code">h2</span> for section headings, and <span class="code">h3</span> for subsection headings. More specific headings are not supported. Clean documentation should not use more than 3 levels of hierarchy. If this feels restrictive, consider restructuring your content:</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
        <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="newthought">In his later books<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">E.g. <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">Beautiful Evidence</a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <span class="code">newthought</span>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. The vertical space is accomplished separately, through the <span class="code">&lt;section&gt;</span> class. The vertical space seems unnecessary when using this technique to replace <span class="code">h2</span> elements, as in this paragaph. Whichever approach you choose, be consistent. Do not alternate use of header elements and the <span class="code">newthought</span> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>
      <h3 id="navcolor">Color</h3>
      <p>Although print handouts typically have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. This approach reduces eye strain and improves readability. The selected hues are <span class="code">#fefefe</span> (background) and <span class="code">#222</span> (text).</p>
      <p>Other types of content, such as links and code, have slightly different visual treatments. Sidenote numbers are bright red to distinguish them from regular text.</p>

      <h3 id="navfont">Font</h3>
      <p>In print, Tufte uses the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See Tufte's comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. However, reading online is a much different experience. The fonts selected are all within the Roboto<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> styles and variations.</span> Family which improve readability. Roboto is the signature font family and the default font on Android and ChromeOS.</p>
      <p>Envisioned CSS includes several Roboto fonts using <span class="code">@font-face</span>. This means you'll have to make the .ttf files available to your readers. By default I've set Roboto Condensed for the body font, however, if you desire more word spacing you can easily which it to Roboto regular.</p>
      <p>Code snippets (using the <span class="code">code</span> class) are RobotoMono-Regular<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Mono">Roboto Mono</a> styles and variations.</span> font.</p>

      <h3 id="navlists">Lists</h3>
      <p>Tufte points out that while lists have valid uses, they tend to promote ineffective writing habits due to their "lack of syntactic and intellectual discipline". He is particularly critical of hierarchical and bullet-pointed lists. So before reaching for an HTML list element, ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does this list actually have to be represented using an HTML <span class="code">ul</span> or <span class="code">ol</span> element?</li>
        <li>Would my idea be better expressed as sentences in paragraphs?</li>
        <li>Is my message causally complex enough to warrant a flow diagram instead?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is but a small subset of a proper overview of the topic of lists in communication. A better way to understand Tufte's thoughts on lists would be to read "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within," a chapter in Tufte's book <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>, excerpted at some length by Tufte himself <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0002QF">on his website</a>. The whole piece is information-dense and therefore difficult to summarize. He speaks to web design specifically, but in terms of examples and principles rather than as a set of simple do-this, don't-do-that prescriptions. It is well worth reading in full for that reason alone.</p>
      <p>For these reasons, Envisioned CSS encourages caution before reaching for a list element, and by default removes the bullet points from unordered lists.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2 id="navnotes">Sidenotes</h2>
      <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte's style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span> Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already.</p>
      <p>On large viewports, Envisioned CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. Sidenotes consist of 1) a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and 2) a sidenote containing content that repeats the superscripted number to reinforce its connection to the text. To add the former, just put <span class="code">&lt;span class="sidenote-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span> where you want the reference to go. Immediately after that goes the <span class="code">span</span> with class <span class="code">sidenote</span>, inserted directly into the middle of the <span class="code">p</span> tag containing the reference text. This will give the sidenote the correct height.</p>
      <p>If you don't want footnote-style numberings on your sidenotes, what you want is a margin note.
        <label for="7" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="marginnote">
          This is a margin note. Notice there isn't a number preceding the note.
        </span> They are almost identical to sidenotes but are kept semantically distinct because they operate differently on small screens. Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="navfigures">Figures</h2>
      <p>Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept in context with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On online, that means graphics and their accompanying text are displayed in context to minimize extra clicks and unnecessary scrolling. On small devices this context has been adapted with minimal clicking.</p>
      <p>Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte’s work<label for="8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="http://placehold.it/396x255.png"/>Figure 1: Visual Comparison of species</span>. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <span class="code">p</span> tag, as seen in Figure 1 to the right of this paragraph.</p>      
      <p>If you need a full-width figure, give it the <span class="code">fullwidth</span> class. Make sure that's inside an <span class="code">article</span>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. Don't wrap the figure in a paragraph tag. To give it a caption, use a <span class="code">figcaption</span> tag inside the <span class="code">figure</span> tag. This approach is demonstrated in Figure 2.</p>
      <p class="code">Data plot description</p>
      <figure class="fullwidth">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/1282x246.png"/>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Full width figure</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br/>
      <p>Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column. You're going to have to police yourself with the size of any images. Wrap the <span class="code">figure</span> tag in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a <span class="code">figcaption</span> tag inside the figure.</p>
      <p>
        <figure>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/757x472.png"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 3: A figure the width of the main column</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="navtables">Tables</h2>
      <p>Tables are presented by default with minimal grid lines. Table labels are margin notes with an additional <span class="code">table-label</span> class, placed inside a <span class="code">div</span> tag of class <span class="code">table-wrapper</span> that wraps the <span class="code">table</span>. Note that on smaller viewports (e.g. tablets and phones) tables will collapse into unordered lists. This adaptive functionality, provided by TableSaw<label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw" target="_blank">Tablesaw</a> was created by <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/" target="_blank">filament group</a>.</span>, makes tabular data easier to consume on small devices.</p>

      <p>Code samples are monospace using the <span class="code">code</span> class, as I've been using in this document to denote HTML tags like the word 'code' earlier in this sentence. Code blocks use that class in conjunction with the <span class="code">pre</span> tag, which gives us indentation too:</p>
      <pre class="code">
// imperative programming:
for (i = 0; i++; i <= num) {
   all_the_things[i].useEnvisioned();
}
      </pre>
