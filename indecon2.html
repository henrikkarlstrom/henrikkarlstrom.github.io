		<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
		<p>Since the 1990s, most European countries have undergone some degree of liberalization of 
		their electricity infrastructures. This has meant exposing parts of the energy sector, 
		such as power generation, to competitive entry, while keeping its other parts, such as 
		electricity grids, intact as regional monopolies operating alongside liberalised energy markets. 
		Inspired by earlier studies on economisation and valuative regimes, this paper investigates the 
		consequences of this transition, using the Norwegian case as an example. We argue that the 
		transition does not constitute economisation in the traditional sense because vital parts of the 
		grid sector remained publicly regulated monopolies. Instead, we find the transition included a 
		shift in governing logic from one soundly rooted in engineering and controlled by elected politicians 
		to one influenced chiefly by economics and controlled by complex calculative regimes in which elected 
		officials are studiously hands-off. We argue this constitutes a form of indirect economization. 
		This process of indirect economisation has had obvious implications for the degree of democratic 
		control over vital societal infrastructure. Thus, we argue that processes of indirect economisation, 
		sure to be found working elsewhere as well, should be studied alongside general economisation in 
		order to grasp clearer their implication in modern, liberal societies.

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>This articles seeks to shed light on the role of economic calculative 
		techniques in the regulation of important societal functions in a modern market-based political economy. 
		We study what kind of mathematical formulas and numbers underpin these techniques, 
		and their changes in recent times. To these ends, we utilise recent concepts from the 
		fields of social studies of markets and valuation studies. We exemplify them by the case of 
		changing regulatory regimes for the income of electricity grid companies in Norway, 
		comparing the current market-based system to the previous regime of total state control over 
		the electricity sector from production to delivery via the grid.
		</p>

		<p>Liberalised energy infrastructures have become the norm throughout Europe in recent decades. 
		This has mostly come about through a transition from a centrally planned, state controlled energy 
		sector to a division between regional distribution monopolies operating alongside competitive suppliers. 
		We investigate this transition in the Norwegian context. Focusing on the grid sector we discuss the 
		implications of transforming the ruling logic of the sector from one grounded in infrastructural and 
		technological development to one of complex, bureaucratic calculative techniques in service of 
		optimizing the status quo.
		</p>
		
		<p>These questions are not just of academic interest. They form part of a political discussion 
		about how to govern an increasingly complex society in an acceptably democratic way. As Rowland and Passoth 
		point out in a review of recent literature on infrastructure and the state, studying «state <i>through</i> 
		infrastructure and the state <i>in</i> infrastructure»<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		have called for studies of what they call economisation, looking at how ever more aspects of society become the object 
		of economic logics and fall under the purview of the field of economics. They mostly focus on how new areas 
		of life become governed by market mechanisms, so-called marketisation, but they also discuss how the logic of 
		competition and the tools, concepts and materials of economics render a phenomenon that used to be seen as 
		outside the grasp of the market as ‘economic’. Following this, Breslau<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		have shown how similar processes have been going on in Norway and Finland respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p>However, there are sectors of society that are not being turned into such market-like entities. 
		With previously integrated societal functions such as infrastructure maintenance becoming separated 
		into market-exposed companies and ‘natural monopolies’, the latter are finding themselves governed by 
		a new set of financial regulations. This is happening even when - according to the original intention - 
		these parts of infrastructures were not supposed to be subjected to market competition and hence efficiency gains. 
		This is certainly a form of economisation, although not in the direct sense of Çaliskan and Callon. 
		Rather, it might be called indirect economisation. Our claim is that the indirect way in which such 
		economisation processes happens has consequences for our understanding of the room for democratic control 
		over vital societal infrastructure.
		</p>
		
		<p>In the upcoming sections we further elaborate the concept of economisation and valuation theory to 
		understand the methods by which economisation has been carried out. We then provide the background of the 
		Norwegian electricity grid regulation regime and an overview over how the governing logic of this system has 
		changed considerably after the introduction of the market liberalisation and the separation of grid operation 
		into natural monopolies. This is intended as a concrete example of how indirect economisation poses some 
		interesting quandaries for the governance of infrastructure and other important societal sectors in modern 
		market society. We argue that this transition to a system of indirect economisation has an impact on the 
		possibilities for transparency in a process that ultimately decides a large part of the costs to end users 
		of having a functional infrastructure that supports almost all aspects of everyday life.

		<h2 id="economisation">Economisation</h2>
		<p>A recent meeting of science and technology studies and economic sociology has resulted in a turn away 
		from structural explanations of the effect of economic phenomena in the social field and towards examining 
		concrete methods of defining, delineating and regulating what Çaliskan & Callon have dubbed the economic: 
		«Rather than asking what the economy (noun) is, there has been a shift towards defining observable criteria 
		which enables one to say that an activity, behaviour or institution is economic 
		(adjective)»<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		towards processes of economization.” <i>Economy and Society</i>, 38 (3): 369–98. 
		</span>
		This allows one to start tracing the way a specific set of logics, tools and techniques taken from the 
		field of economics is moved into new fields and brought to bear on issues that were previously considered 
		to operate under logics of their own.
		</p>
		
		<p>One example of this movement is the change in how radio frequencies have been awarded to potential 
		stations in the US since the 1990s. Instead of (somewhat paternalistically) considering ‘the public good’, 
		regulators now set up auctions and offer frequencies to the highest bidder, using auction theory from 
		economics<label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		</span>
		This marked a shift in governing logics, but also of course a shift in power to one type of market actor 
		(commercial radio stations) away from another (non-profit or communal radio stations). 
		Economisation theory claims that tracing the movement of such conceptual and theoretical tools as well 
		as the concrete technologies by which concepts manifest themselves is a necessary condition for understanding 
		the outcomes of these processes, and ultimately one central aspect of the development of modern market-based politics and society.
		</p>
		
		<p>To date, by far the most common utilisation of economisation theory and its sibling concept of performativity 
		has been in the study of the financial sector. It has been used to show how specific economic framings of the 
		function of the stock market and other financial institutions have led to a historic decoupling of the financial 
		sector from other parts of society. This has potentially laid the ground for an increasing leveraging of financial 
		institutions through acceleration of the circulation of money to the point where humans are barely capable of 
		understanding the entanglements.<label for="15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		<p>Because of its focus on the material dimensions of such processes, economisation theory is particularly suited for 
		shedding light on the increasingly depoliticised processes by which economic logics inform and influence public governance. 
		Following economic materiality can account for changes in the economy, with the understanding that new tools, methods and 
		techniques can lead to new economic phenomena. This is the reasoning behind the interest in so-called ‘market devices’, 
		algorithms, trading schemes, price formulas and similar techniques that are the battlefield of complex technical 
		deliberations that ultimately guide much of modern life.<label for="20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		call them, are that as they have specific material effects, they are technologies which can be followed and 
		analysed with some precision.
		</p>
		
		<p>Still, economisation theory has only barely started to scratch the surface of a rapidly expanding and polymorphous field. 
		As Çaliskan and Callon point out, the marketisation processes they study represent merely one of many points of attack along 
		these lines. This article tries to go beyond previous discussions of economisation and into areas which exhibit some of 
		the same traits as ‘straightforwardly’ economised sectors of society, but where these traits emerge almost as a 
		by-product of changes that happen in related, neighbouring sectors of the economy. Such processes of what might be called 
		indirect economization would denote areas of society that are not exactly privatized or turned into pseudo-markets but are 
		still affected by such processes.
		</p>
		
		<p>One case with the potential for revealing effects of indirect economization is the regulation of the income of the 
		Norwegian electricity grid companies, which due to the deregulation of the production side of the electricity system has 
		had its status changed from an integrated part of electricity utilities to being separated into stand-alone companies whose 
		only task is to maintain the electricity grid. Since the grid is now considered a ‘natural monopoly’ with a series of 
		regionally based, non-competitive companies, their potential to misuse the monopoly status to extort unduly high profits 
		is tightly controlled by a complex set of regulations, bureaucratic techniques and algorithms that are the subject of annual 
		legal conflicts between the state and the grid companies.
		</p>
		
		<p>These legal conflicts are under the post-liberalized system a new phenomenon governing the grid sector. Their outcomes are 
		only visible to a very small set of professionals involved in the negotiations around the income regulation of grid companies, 
		but they potentially affect every single electricity user in the country. By tracing the intricacies of the regulations and how 
		it has evolved under the post-liberalized era, we see how the different actors mobilize economic concepts and calculative 
		techniques to win the argument for their side. It is possible to get a grasp of how economisation of one sector - 
		the production side of electricity - can have deep and lasting indirect consequences for a different one. However, to do this, 
		an understanding of valuative regimes is necessary.

		Karpik, Lucien. 2010. <i>Valuing the Unique: The Economics of Singularities</i>. Princeton University Press.
		</span>		
		These calculative regimes are, of course, not neutral. They rely on specific assumptions about what should be part of the 
		calculation and what shouldn’t, and even more on what is considered to be valuable: «We can never simply calculate because 
		we must do so with units and instruments of measurement that are deeply structured by accounts of what can be of 
		value».<label for="23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		<p>Calculations can powerfully shape the conditions under which choices are made and determined. This may be linked 
		with what many have identified as the increasingly technocratic nature of modern political decision making. As ever more 
		decisions by policy makers are made with reference to predictions of future developments or the application of carefully 
		framed statistics, a new set of ‘de-politicised’ policy decisions that nevertheless can have large actual implications for 
		citizens arise.<label for="24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		In situations where the traditional logic of politics no longer carries with it the same weight, calculations themselves 
		often become the site of controversy - rather than debate ideology, one argues over technicalities. Controversies, while 
		reflecting at times deep-seated differences in ideological outlook, often take the form of disagreements about the technical 
		aspects of regulatory regimes. Calculations become proxies for differences in politics. At the same time, calculations and 
		technicalities are often hard to understand for those affected by these technical decisions. Even if technical solutions 
		provide procedural stability, movement from politics to technicalities carries with it a political aspect all of its own.
		</p>
		
		<p>Much of the valuation literature has focused on the discursive frames that allow one to perform calculations on previously 
		incommensurable entities.<label for="25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="25" class="margin-toggle"/>

		</span>
		However, taking the economisation theory discussed above into consideration it might be equally interesting to 
		study the concrete socio-technical infrastructures which underlie calculations and make them possible. A focus 
		on these infrastructures can demonstrate not only the sites of controversy, but provide specific, empirical 
		examples of where these controversies play out and review their consequences. 
		In the following, we will review and compare the governing logics of the pre- and post-liberalised grid regimes. 
		We wish to show that the way a set of specific calculations are framed and carried out is the cornerstone of a 
		change in regulatory policies that can have far-reaching effects.

      <p>The above snippet needs to live within the <span class="code">body</span> tag, but it must reside above the rest of the page content. So the navigation can nudge the content over, put the entirety your <span class="code">article</span> within a <span class="code">div</span> tag:</p>
      
      <pre class="code">
      	&lt;div id="container"/&gt;
            &lt;article&gt;
            	&lt;section&gt;
                	&lt;p&gt;Section 1 Content&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/section&gt;
                &lt;section&gt;
                	&lt;p&gt;Section 2 Content&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </pre>
      
      <h3>Sections</h3>
      <p>Organize your document with an <span class="code">article</span> element inside your <span class="code">body</span> tag. Inside that, use <span class="code">section</span> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>

      <h3>Headings</h3>
      <p>Envisioned CSS uses <span class="code">h1</span> for the page title, <span class="code">h2</span> for section headings, and <span class="code">h3</span> for subsection headings. More specific headings are not supported. Clean documentation should not use more than 3 levels of hierarchy. If this feels restrictive, consider restructuring your content:</p>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
        <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p><span class="newthought">In his later books<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">E.g. <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">Beautiful Evidence</a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <span class="code">newthought</span>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. The vertical space is accomplished separately, through the <span class="code">&lt;section&gt;</span> class. The vertical space seems unnecessary when using this technique to replace <span class="code">h2</span> elements, as in this paragaph. Whichever approach you choose, be consistent. Do not alternate use of header elements and the <span class="code">newthought</span> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>
      <h3 id="navcolor">Color</h3>
      <p>Although print handouts typically have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. This approach reduces eye strain and improves readability. The selected hues are <span class="code">#fefefe</span> (background) and <span class="code">#222</span> (text).</p>
      <p>Other types of content, such as links and code, have slightly different visual treatments. Sidenote numbers are bright red to distinguish them from regular text.</p>

      <h3 id="navfont">Font</h3>
      <p>In print, Tufte uses the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See Tufte's comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. However, reading online is a much different experience. The fonts selected are all within the Roboto<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> styles and variations.</span> Family which improve readability. Roboto is the signature font family and the default font on Android and ChromeOS.</p>
      <p>Envisioned CSS includes several Roboto fonts using <span class="code">@font-face</span>. This means you'll have to make the .ttf files available to your readers. By default I've set Roboto Condensed for the body font, however, if you desire more word spacing you can easily which it to Roboto regular.</p>
      <p>Code snippets (using the <span class="code">code</span> class) are RobotoMono-Regular<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Mono">Roboto Mono</a> styles and variations.</span> font.</p>

      <h3 id="navlists">Lists</h3>
      <p>Tufte points out that while lists have valid uses, they tend to promote ineffective writing habits due to their "lack of syntactic and intellectual discipline". He is particularly critical of hierarchical and bullet-pointed lists. So before reaching for an HTML list element, ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does this list actually have to be represented using an HTML <span class="code">ul</span> or <span class="code">ol</span> element?</li>
        <li>Would my idea be better expressed as sentences in paragraphs?</li>
        <li>Is my message causally complex enough to warrant a flow diagram instead?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is but a small subset of a proper overview of the topic of lists in communication. A better way to understand Tufte's thoughts on lists would be to read "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within," a chapter in Tufte's book <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>, excerpted at some length by Tufte himself <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0002QF">on his website</a>. The whole piece is information-dense and therefore difficult to summarize. He speaks to web design specifically, but in terms of examples and principles rather than as a set of simple do-this, don't-do-that prescriptions. It is well worth reading in full for that reason alone.</p>
      <p>For these reasons, Envisioned CSS encourages caution before reaching for a list element, and by default removes the bullet points from unordered lists.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="navnotes">Sidenotes</h2>
      <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte's style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span> Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already.</p>
      <p>On large viewports, Envisioned CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. Sidenotes consist of 1) a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and 2) a sidenote containing content that repeats the superscripted number to reinforce its connection to the text. To add the former, just put <span class="code">&lt;span class="sidenote-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span> where you want the reference to go. Immediately after that goes the <span class="code">span</span> with class <span class="code">sidenote</span>, inserted directly into the middle of the <span class="code">p</span> tag containing the reference text. This will give the sidenote the correct height.</p>
      <p>If you don't want footnote-style numberings on your sidenotes, what you want is a margin note.
        <label for="7" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="marginnote">
          This is a margin note. Notice there isn't a number preceding the note.
        </span> They are almost identical to sidenotes but are kept semantically distinct because they operate differently on small screens. Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="navfigures">Figures</h2>
      <p>Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept in context with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On online, that means graphics and their accompanying text are displayed in context to minimize extra clicks and unnecessary scrolling. On small devices this context has been adapted with minimal clicking.</p>
      <p>Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte’s work<label for="8" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="http://placehold.it/396x255.png"/>Figure 1: Visual Comparison of species</span>. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <span class="code">p</span> tag, as seen in Figure 1 to the right of this paragraph.</p>      
      <p>If you need a full-width figure, give it the <span class="code">fullwidth</span> class. Make sure that's inside an <span class="code">article</span>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. Don't wrap the figure in a paragraph tag. To give it a caption, use a <span class="code">figcaption</span> tag inside the <span class="code">figure</span> tag. This approach is demonstrated in Figure 2.</p>
      <p class="code">Data plot description</p>
      <figure class="fullwidth">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/1282x246.png"/>
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Full width figure</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br/>
      <p>Besides margin and full width figures, you can of course also include figures constrained to the main column. You're going to have to police yourself with the size of any images. Wrap the <span class="code">figure</span> tag in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a <span class="code">figcaption</span> tag inside the figure.</p>
      <p>
        <figure>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/757x472.png"/>
          <figcaption>Figure 3: A figure the width of the main column</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="navtables">Tables</h2>
      <p>Tables are presented by default with minimal grid lines. Table labels are margin notes with an additional <span class="code">table-label</span> class, placed inside a <span class="code">div</span> tag of class <span class="code">table-wrapper</span> that wraps the <span class="code">table</span>. Note that on smaller viewports (e.g. tablets and phones) tables will collapse into unordered lists. This adaptive functionality, provided by TableSaw<label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw" target="_blank">Tablesaw</a> was created by <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/" target="_blank">filament group</a>.</span>, makes tabular data easier to consume on small devices.</p>
        <div class="table-wrapper">
          <span class="table-caption">

    <section>
      <h2 id="navcode">Code</h2>
      <p>Code samples are monospace using the <span class="code">code</span> class, as I've been using in this document to denote HTML tags like the word 'code' earlier in this sentence. Code blocks use that class in conjunction with the <span class="code">pre</span> tag, which gives us indentation too:</p>
      <pre class="code">
// imperative programming:
for (i = 0; i++; i <= num) {
   all_the_things[i].useEnvisioned();
}
