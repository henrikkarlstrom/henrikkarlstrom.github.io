		<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
		<p>Since the 1990s, most European countries have undergone some degree of liberalization of 
		their electricity infrastructures. This has meant exposing parts of the energy sector, 
		such as power generation, to competitive entry, while keeping its other parts, such as 
		electricity grids, intact as regional monopolies operating alongside liberalised energy markets. 
		Inspired by earlier studies on economisation and valuative regimes, this paper investigates the 
		consequences of this transition, using the Norwegian case as an example. We argue that the 
		transition does not constitute economisation in the traditional sense because vital parts of the 
		grid sector remained publicly regulated monopolies. Instead, we find the transition included a 
		shift in governing logic from one soundly rooted in engineering and controlled by elected politicians 
		to one influenced chiefly by economics and controlled by complex calculative regimes in which elected 
		officials are studiously hands-off. We argue this constitutes a form of indirect economization. 
		This process of indirect economisation has had obvious implications for the degree of democratic 
		control over vital societal infrastructure. Thus, we argue that processes of indirect economisation, 
		sure to be found working elsewhere as well, should be studied alongside general economisation in 
		order to grasp clearer their implication in modern, liberal societies.

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>This article seeks to shed light on the role of economic calculative 
		techniques in the regulation of important societal functions in a modern market-based political economy. 
		We study what kind of mathematical formulas and numbers underpin these techniques, 
		and their changes in recent times. To these ends, we utilise recent concepts from the 
		fields of social studies of markets and valuation studies. We exemplify them by the case of 
		changing regulatory regimes for the income of electricity grid companies in Norway, 
		comparing the current market-based system to the previous regime of total state control over 
		the electricity sector from production to delivery via the grid.
		</p>

		<p>Liberalised energy infrastructures have become the norm throughout Europe in recent decades. 
		This has mostly come about through a transition from a centrally planned, state controlled energy 
		sector to a division between regional distribution monopolies operating alongside competitive suppliers. 
		We investigate this transition in the Norwegian context. Focusing on the grid sector we discuss the 
		implications of transforming the ruling logic of the sector from one grounded in infrastructural and 
		technological development to one of complex, bureaucratic calculative techniques in service of 
		optimizing the status quo.
		</p>
		
		<p>These questions are not just of academic interest. They form part of a political discussion 
		about how to govern an increasingly complex society in an acceptably democratic way. As Rowland and Passoth 
		point out in a review of recent literature on infrastructure and the state, studying «state <i>through</i> 
		infrastructure and the state <i>in</i> infrastructure»<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		have called for studies of what they call economisation, looking at how ever more aspects of society become the object 
		of economic logics and fall under the purview of the field of economics. They mostly focus on how new areas 
		of life become governed by market mechanisms, so-called marketisation, but they also discuss how the logic of 
		competition and the tools, concepts and materials of economics render a phenomenon that used to be seen as 
		outside the grasp of the market as ‘economic’. Following this, Breslau<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		have shown how similar processes have been going on in Norway and Finland respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p>However, there are sectors of society that are not being turned into such market-like entities. 
		With previously integrated societal functions such as infrastructure maintenance becoming separated 
		into market-exposed companies and ‘natural monopolies’, the latter are finding themselves governed by 
		a new set of financial regulations. This is happening even when - according to the original intention - 
		these parts of infrastructures were not supposed to be subjected to market competition and hence efficiency gains. 
		This is certainly a form of economisation, although not in the direct sense of Çaliskan and Callon. 
		Rather, it might be called indirect economisation. Our claim is that the indirect way in which such 
		economisation processes happens has consequences for our understanding of the room for democratic control 
		over vital societal infrastructure.
		</p>
		
		<p>In the upcoming sections we further elaborate the concept of economisation and valuation theory to 
		understand the methods by which economisation has been carried out. We then provide the background of the 
		Norwegian electricity grid regulation regime and an overview over how the governing logic of this system has 
		changed considerably after the introduction of the market liberalisation and the separation of grid operation 
		into natural monopolies. This is intended as a concrete example of how indirect economisation poses some 
		interesting quandaries for the governance of infrastructure and other important societal sectors in modern 
		market society. We argue that this transition to a system of indirect economisation has an impact on the 
		possibilities for transparency in a process that ultimately decides a large part of the costs to end users 
		of having a functional infrastructure that supports almost all aspects of everyday life.

		<h2 id="economisation">Economisation</h2>
		<p>A recent meeting of science and technology studies and economic sociology has resulted in a turn away 
		from structural explanations of the effect of economic phenomena in the social field and towards examining 
		concrete methods of defining, delineating and regulating what Çaliskan & Callon have dubbed the economic: 
		«Rather than asking what the economy (noun) is, there has been a shift towards defining observable criteria 
		which enables one to say that an activity, behaviour or institution is economic 
		(adjective)»<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		towards processes of economization.” <i>Economy and Society</i>, 38 (3): 369–98. 
		</span>
		This allows one to start tracing the way a specific set of logics, tools and techniques taken from the 
		field of economics is moved into new fields and brought to bear on issues that were previously considered 
		to operate under logics of their own.
		</p>
		
		<p>One example of this movement is the change in how radio frequencies have been awarded to potential 
		stations in the US since the 1990s. Instead of (somewhat paternalistically) considering ‘the public good’, 
		regulators now set up auctions and offer frequencies to the highest bidder, using auction theory from 
		economics<label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		</span>
		This marked a shift in governing logics, but also of course a shift in power to one type of market actor 
		(commercial radio stations) away from another (non-profit or communal radio stations). 
		Economisation theory claims that tracing the movement of such conceptual and theoretical tools as well 
		as the concrete technologies by which concepts manifest themselves is a necessary condition for understanding 
		the outcomes of these processes, and ultimately one central aspect of the development of modern market-based politics and society.
		</p>
		
		<p>To date, by far the most common utilisation of economisation theory and its sibling concept of performativity 
		has been in the study of the financial sector. It has been used to show how specific economic framings of the 
		function of the stock market and other financial institutions have led to a historic decoupling of the financial 
		sector from other parts of society. This has potentially laid the ground for an increasing leveraging of financial 
		institutions through acceleration of the circulation of money to the point where humans are barely capable of 
		understanding the entanglements.<label for="15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		<p>Because of its focus on the material dimensions of such processes, economisation theory is particularly suited for 
		shedding light on the increasingly depoliticised processes by which economic logics inform and influence public governance. 
		Following economic materiality can account for changes in the economy, with the understanding that new tools, methods and 
		techniques can lead to new economic phenomena. This is the reasoning behind the interest in so-called ‘market devices’, 
		algorithms, trading schemes, price formulas and similar techniques that are the battlefield of complex technical 
		deliberations that ultimately guide much of modern life.<label for="20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		call them, are that as they have specific material effects, they are technologies which can be followed and 
		analysed with some precision.
		</p>
		
		<p>Still, economisation theory has only barely started to scratch the surface of a rapidly expanding and polymorphous field. 
		As Çaliskan and Callon point out, the marketisation processes they study represent merely one of many points of attack along 
		these lines. This article tries to go beyond previous discussions of economisation and into areas which exhibit some of 
		the same traits as ‘straightforwardly’ economised sectors of society, but where these traits emerge almost as a 
		by-product of changes that happen in related, neighbouring sectors of the economy. Such processes of what might be called 
		indirect economization would denote areas of society that are not exactly privatized or turned into pseudo-markets but are 
		still affected by such processes.
		</p>
		
		<p>One case with the potential for revealing effects of indirect economization is the regulation of the income of the 
		Norwegian electricity grid companies, which due to the deregulation of the production side of the electricity system has 
		had its status changed from an integrated part of electricity utilities to being separated into stand-alone companies whose 
		only task is to maintain the electricity grid. Since the grid is now considered a ‘natural monopoly’ with a series of 
		regionally based, non-competitive companies, their potential to misuse the monopoly status to extort unduly high profits 
		is tightly controlled by a complex set of regulations, bureaucratic techniques and algorithms that are the subject of annual 
		legal conflicts between the state and the grid companies.
		</p>
		
		<p>These legal conflicts are under the post-liberalized system a new phenomenon governing the grid sector. Their outcomes are 
		only visible to a very small set of professionals involved in the negotiations around the income regulation of grid companies, 
		but they potentially affect every single electricity user in the country. By tracing the intricacies of the regulations and how 
		it has evolved under the post-liberalized era, we see how the different actors mobilize economic concepts and calculative 
		techniques to win the argument for their side. It is possible to get a grasp of how economisation of one sector - 
		the production side of electricity - can have deep and lasting indirect consequences for a different one. However, to do this, 
		an understanding of valuative regimes is necessary.

		Karpik, Lucien. 2010. <i>Valuing the Unique: The Economics of Singularities</i>. Princeton University Press.
		</span>		
		These calculative regimes are, of course, not neutral. They rely on specific assumptions about what should be part of the 
		calculation and what shouldn’t, and even more on what is considered to be valuable: «We can never simply calculate because 
		we must do so with units and instruments of measurement that are deeply structured by accounts of what can be of 
		value».<label for="23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		<p>Calculations can powerfully shape the conditions under which choices are made and determined. This may be linked 
		with what many have identified as the increasingly technocratic nature of modern political decision making. As ever more 
		decisions by policy makers are made with reference to predictions of future developments or the application of carefully 
		framed statistics, a new set of ‘de-politicised’ policy decisions that nevertheless can have large actual implications for 
		citizens arise.<label for="24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		In situations where the traditional logic of politics no longer carries with it the same weight, calculations themselves 
		often become the site of controversy - rather than debate ideology, one argues over technicalities. Controversies, while 
		reflecting at times deep-seated differences in ideological outlook, often take the form of disagreements about the technical 
		aspects of regulatory regimes. Calculations become proxies for differences in politics. At the same time, calculations and 
		technicalities are often hard to understand for those affected by these technical decisions. Even if technical solutions 
		provide procedural stability, movement from politics to technicalities carries with it a political aspect all of its own.
		</p>
		
		<p>Much of the valuation literature has focused on the discursive frames that allow one to perform calculations on previously 
		incommensurable entities.<label for="25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		However, taking the economisation theory discussed above into consideration it might be equally interesting to 
		study the concrete socio-technical infrastructures which underlie calculations and make them possible. A focus 
		on these infrastructures can demonstrate not only the sites of controversy, but provide specific, empirical 
		examples of where these controversies play out and review their consequences. 
		In the following, we will review and compare the governing logics of the pre- and post-liberalised grid regimes. 
		We wish to show that the way a set of specific calculations are framed and carried out is the cornerstone of a 
		change in regulatory policies that can have far-reaching effects.

		Blessed with an abundance of waterfalls and a commitment to providing citizens (and, lest we forget, businesses) 
		with cheap and secure sources of electricity, the developers of the Norwegian electricity system spent the first 
		sixty years of the 20th century expanding the production and distribution capabilities of electricity utilities.
		</p>

		<p>From the start, the electricity system was conceived as a total service provider to the Norwegian public - 
		it should provide sufficient amounts of electricity at reasonable prices to end users and maintain an electrical 
		grid that would ensure security of delivery through adverse situations such as dry autumns, cold winters or sudden 
		surges of demand.<label for="26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		</span>
		Under the prevailing engineering logic of the post-war period, it was considered most rational that production 
		and distribution be kept within the same unit. Maximum stability both for customers and utilities would be achieved 
		through the construction of regional monopolies for supplying power, where profits from the sale of electricity would 
		subsidise the maintenance of the grid.
		</p>

		<p>One feature of this commitment to guaranteed supply of electricity was the need, under an engineering dominated logic, 
		to ensure that the system could run even during demand peaks.<label for="27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		</span>
		As a consequence the Norwegian electricity system was somewhat over-dimensioned. Construction of new plants was started 
		before demand could completely catch up with supply, often with an eye to which strategic developments could be had from it, 
		for example through stimulating growth in certain parts of the country by opening hydro plants where one wanted to attract industry.
		</p>

		<p>From the point of view of supply and demand, this was an enormous waste of societal resources. The system relied entirely on a 
		form of centralized planning that in the 1980s was beginning to be viewed with a certain scepticism both from social scientists 
		(economists and political scientists) and political agents in general. Rather, there was a move towards what was seen as a more 
		organic, self-organising principle of supply and demand with regards to business and the dimensioning of infrastructures. 
		It would no longer be the role of the central state to dictate where and under what circumstances businesses should locate.
		</p>
		
		<p>Before the liberalisation of the Norwegian electricity market in 1990, there was no general public market for electricity in Norway. 
		Rather, there was a limited and internal auction-based electricity trading scheme within Norway and between certain actors and their 
		international counterparts<label for="28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		, and the sector was subject to strict price controls. Prices were set by Parliament on a yearly basis, based on engineers’ 
		predictions of the long-term marginal cost of production (LTMCP) for electricity, which took into account the cost of building 
		new plants with a certain depreciation factor as well as predictions of future demand levels.
		</p>
		
		<p>The LTMCP is an interesting case of one type of economic calculative technique that was present in the Norwegian electricity 
		infrastructure from the very start. It relied on a specific set of assumptions that were seldom challenged, and which 
		shaped both the way Norwegians were allowed to use electricity and the very landscape of the country itself.
		<label for="30" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="30" class="margin-toggle">
		<span class="marginnote">
		<span style="display: block;">A typical LTMCP equation: <br />
		<span class="math display">
		<span class="math display">\[LTMCPy = \sum_{t=T_i}^{T_f}a_t\frac{\Delta C_p(t)\times (1+p)^{-(t-YR)}}{\Delta P(t)\times (1+p)^{-(t-YR)}}\]
		</span></span></span></span>
		The LTMCP represents a typical engineering approach to infrastructure dimensioning. By assuming that the demand for electricity 
		was linearly scalable and projecting historical trends into the future, it was calculated according to a formula similar to 
		the example, which is still used to a certain degree in making projections of the future price of electricity.
		</p>

		<p>In this formula, the yearly long-term marginal cost of production of electricity is seen as a function of the yearly cost 
		of constructing the new plants that would be needed because of the linear growth in demand as averaged over a period of some 
		<i>t</i> years (usually 30) combined with the actual marginal cost of producing an extra kWh of electricity in existing plants. 
		Because the marginal cost of hydroelectricity after initial investments are made is very low, old power plants become very 
		profitable after some decades, and the added income from some of the older utilities in the south of Norway was used, 
		together with handsome state guarantees, to subsidise newer less profitable ones. Through the linking of profits from old 
		plants and subsidies for constructing new plants, the system worked to perpetuate itself, with ever more power plants being 
		constructed as a result, sometimes at great cost both to taxpayers and to local environments.
		</p>
		
		<p>As mentioned, this way of operating was not seen very favourably by economists. Not only did it entail the use of regional 
		monopolies for the production of electricity, but there was also governmental price control, meaning utilities had little 
		chance or incentive to make changes to achieve efficiency gains. In addition, the use of cross-subsidies internally in the 
		utilities and tax-funded state guarantees in cases of loss of income for utilities meant that it was very opaque what the 
		production of electricity was really costing the Norwegian public.
		</p>
		
		<p>Through a concerted effort over decades from economists, entailing the production of more than sixty research reports and 
		hundreds of public debate articles from economists working at the Norwegian School of Economics, combined with the general 
		shift towards more market-oriented forms of governance through the 1980s that saw the election of the first non-Labour 
		government in a long time in 1989, a shift from an engineering logic to an economic logic happened. In 1990, a new Energy Act 
		was passed, splitting electricity production and distribution into two sectors with different governance logics.
		</p>
		
		<p>In the current setup the Norwegian electricity system after production and sale of electricity is separated from 
		distribution and grid maintenance. In contrast to the politically defined electricity price of yore, prices are now set 
		in the competitive market for production utilities. For end-use, the role of the consumer is reacting to price information. 
		The Norwegian Competition Authorities provide consumers with a continuously updated web portal where they can compare prices 
		and different pricing schemes.<label for="31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="31" class="margin-toggle">

		</span>
		Norway has also been very active in reducing barriers to utility changing. Without a doubt, Norwegian households have been 
		encouraged to see themselves as actors in a market for electricity that should engage in price arbitrage, i.e. the possibility 
		to switch between competing utilities in order to keep prices down and the pressure for efficiency on the side of 
		companies up.<label for="32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		<p>This shows how the production side of electricity was identified as a prime target for a conscious economisation effort, 
		moving from an engineering logic to using the tools of economics to deliver a new politics of electricity in Norway. 
		What about the other side of the system, the grid companies that could not be subjected to competition because it makes no 
		sense to impose competition on physical infrastructure? Like other fixed infrastructures such as roads or railroads, the 
		governance of the electricity grid is still considered a ‘natural monopoly’ in economic terms. This is due to the nature of 
		these systems, where it makes very little sense to try and construct competing systems alongside the existing ones. Rather, 
		ways to simulate competition are sought. This often takes the form of public regulation of the maximum income of the grid companies, 
		encouraging them to focus on improving efficiency rather than increasing prices in order to receive increased revenue.
		</p>
	
		<p>In order to avoid the possible misuse of their monopoly status, Norwegian grid companies see their income strictly regulated by 
		the Norwegian Water and Energy Directorate (NVE). NVE subjects the grid companies to yearly price controls based on reports of the 
		size their customer base, projections of their costs in the coming year and calculations of a large set of other factors such as 
		land rent, interest rates, equipment investment depreciation and the like. These price controls rely on a host of calculative 
		techniques to be effective, which are constantly being challenged by the companies subjected to them. These techniques range from 
		projections of economic development and simulated future demand to retroactive adjustments of budgets to fit updated information about 
		costs and income. This is obviously constitutes a case in which we have calculative devices that

		would refer to as having effective rather than generic performativity. As we shall see in the following, their introduction 
		marks a significant difference compared to the situation in which they were absent.
		</p>

		<p>The figure below gives a partial picture of how one such calculation of the income roof for a grid company is produced. 
		It was used in determining the income roof of grid companies in 2007, and is taken from one of the procedural documents used by 
		NVE to determine the allowed income roof for the period 2006-2008.<label for="34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		This document details not only the process NVE follows to establish the yearly allowed income for 
		the grid companies, but also the procedure whereby the companies have an opportunity to contest the findings of NVE on the basis 
		of wrongful representation of their own or NVE’s data. Of course, in the final instance NVE is still regulator, and acts as judge 
		in determining the merit of a complaint or counter-calculation, but the document lays out the reasoning behind each calculation and 
		appeals decision.

        </figure>
		<br>
		<p>In this formula, we see a single, seemingly simple formula for the calculation of the current year’s allowed income (<i>TI</i> 
		<sub>[year]</sub>) 
		at the top, containing only four terms. However, these terms are themselves nested formulas containing more terms that can be 
		traced in other policy documents.
		<label for="35" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="35" class="margin-toggle">
		<span class="marginnote">
		<span style="display: block;">The formula for calculating allowed income for grid companies:<br />
		<span class="math display">
		<span class="math display">\[TI_{2007} = IR_{2007} + KON_{2007} + E_{2007} - KILE_{2007}\]
		</span></span></span></span>
		Each of the terms of the formula needs to be specified according to rules found in other regulatory 
		documents scattered between different regulatory bodies with very different scopes of action, such as the Ministry of Energy, NVE, 
		Statistics Norway and the Central Bank.
		</p>


		<p>To take only the general formula itself, the state provides companies with a calculation of yearly grid costs (<i>KON</i> <sub>[year]</sub>), 
		municipalities impose property taxes (<i>E</i> <sub>[year]</sub>) and there is a separate calculation for what is termed costs of delivery loss 
		(<i>KILE</i> <sub>[year]</sub>) that are incurred when the grid company fails to deliver electricity to institutional customers (such as factories or 
		hospitals) that rely on secure and constant delivery of electricity. The municipal property taxes are the result of yearly political 
		negotiations and belong to a process separate from the grid regulation. The delivery loss costs result from legal processes where NVE 
		afford institutional customers compensation according to the strength of their claims of damages incurred from loss of delivery from 
		the grid companies. These legal processes are solved according to separate calculative processes detailed in a different set of 
		regulatory documents.
		</p> 

		<p>To demonstrate the bureaucratic complexity of these calculative techniques, we can further unpack one of the nested terms of the 
		original <i>TI</i> <sub>[year]</sub> calculation, the income roof (<i>IR</i> <sub>[year]</sub>).
		<label for="36" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="36" class="margin-toggle">
		<span class="marginnote">
		<span style="display: block;">The formula for calculating income roof for a given year:<br />
		<span class="math display">
		<span class="math display">\[IR_{2007} = 0,5 K_{2007} + 0,5 *K_{2007} + JP_{2007}\]
		</span></span></span></span>		
		While acting as an input term in <i>TI</i> <sub>[year]</sub>, it is itself a formula consisting 
		of three terms. The last term, the investment addition (<i>JP</i> <sub>[year]</sub>), is an additional term that allows for the company investments. 
		Similarly, the grid company contributes their account of cost basis for a given year, and NVE provide what they call a cost norm for 
		what they expect a company of a certain size and scope to have in costs, and these two terms each make up half of the final cost basis 
		(hence the cost basis <i>K</i> is set to 0,5 each for the company and NVE).
		</p>

		<p>While it is not possible to discern how NVE calculate their half of <i>K</i> from the above mentioned document, the company is required to 
		provide a break-down of the number, given as a set of terms in <i>K</i> <sub>[year]</sub>.

		</span></span></span></span>
		These are the costs of running and maintaining the electricity 
		grid (<i>DV</i> <sub>[year-2]</sub>)in the formula), the general rise in costs given by the consumer price index (<i>KPI</i> <sub>[year]</sub>, which is 
		provided yearly on the basis of calculations by Statistics Norway), a reference price of buying electricity through the electricity 
		exchange NordPool (<i>P</i> <sub>[year]</sub>, set on the basis of the weighted average monthly consumption in the various grid regions of Norway) 
		and some more terms for write-downs of the value of invested grid capital (<i>AVS</i> <sub>[year-2]</sub> and <i>AKG</i> <sub>[year-2]</sub>).
		</p>

		<p>The last term of <i>K</i> <sub>[year]</sub> is the general reference interest rate <i>r</i> <sub>[year]</sub>.

		This number is provided by the Bank of Norway each year as an average of the interest rates it provides throughout the year. 
		The determination of the interest rate relies on a host of terms

		these terms is itself the result of calculative negotiations originating elsewhere in the socio-technical regime of ‘the economy’.

		terms.

	<section>
	<h2 id="calcudem">Calculative democracy</h2>
		<p>As we can see, the construction of a single number that ultimately determines how much the grid company is allowed to charge its 
		customers in a given year rests on a host of other calculations. These again are subject to the same calculative and re-calculative 
		techniques that lend weight to their legitimacy, so that trying to follow all of them leads to a merry dance of justificatory calculations 
		and numbers that may seem abstract but which have real consequences. Untangling these calculations and tracing their lineage through other 
		calculations reveal something about the nature of technologies of governance, but it still remains a rather opaque process. Even armed with 
		the level-headed and thorough explanation of all the terms of the various formulas that prefaces all the documents consulted in this case, 
		it is hard to evaluate the value of the claims made by the calculations. For example, knowing that a reference rate of discounts for 
		investments (<i>JP</i> <sub>[year]</sub>) exists does not provide much of an explanation of who came up with that particular formula, which deliberations went 
		into its inclusion (and the exclusion of other terms) or even what that number is - this is proprietary information, only shared by NVE and 
		the company in question. A look at these formulas also reveals the importance of paper trails in modern bureaucracies. While the specific 
		formulas that govern grid company income were found in a single policy document, their genesis and the calculative rationale behind them 
		cannot be found in any one place - in fact, to arrive at the very limited overview of Figure 1 provided above a total of eight different 
		documents must be consulted (see Appendix), and this is leaving out the terms that come from the financial sector or the careful calculations 
		of the central statistical bureau of Norway. Rather, the varying rules for determining the input factors in the formulas are detailed in a 
		bewildering array of regulatory documents, not all of which are made public for more than the short period of time they are up for negotiation 
		between the grid companies and the state. It is also not always clear where one can go to identify the terms used in the various calculations, 
		as these regulatory documents only sometimes carry references to other such documents. On the whole, the process strongly relies on the 
		competencies of a few insiders with the tacit knowledge of where and under what circumstances such calculations are produced. All in all, 
		it is questionable whether more than a few people in each company (or their hired consultants) as well as a small group in NVE ever take part 
		in these negotiations or would know how to evaluate the claims and positions present. Yet the outcomes affect us all.
		</p>
	
		<p>Another important aspect of these calculative techniques is their role as foci of contests of power between actors in the electricity 
		market and the state. Every one of these calculations is the site of potential controversy. For example, by the time of the documents 
		detailed above, it had been decided that the value for the cost norm of grid companies that was provided by NVE would be changed from 
		0.5 <i>K*</i> to 0.6 <i>K*</i> (and consequently, that the grid companies’ share of the cost basis would go down to 0.4 <i>K</i>) in 
		order to reduce the impact of widely differing cost basis from the companies. This led to complaints from grid companies that the state, 
		an external actor with limited insight into the internal economy of the companies, had a too large impact on the income of grid companies. 
		These complaints were not borne out, as the NVE ruled that the state had the right to set the terms of income for the grid companies.
		</p>

		<p>The correct compensation utilities have to pay customers in cases of lack of delivery, the <i>KILE</i> number, is another contentious 
		calculation where large-scale buyers of electricity were also drawn in as afflicted parties in the legal push and pull between utilities and 
		regulators. In fact, these calculations form the basis for sustained legal battles between grid companies which seek to maximise their annual 
		income and the regulators that try to limit the abuse of monopoly power.
		</p>

		<p>This is not to say that there is an entirely antagonistic relationship between the state and the grid companies. It is clear that in 
		many ways the current regulatory system is the result of a longstanding negotiation and back-and-forth between regulator and regulated 
		over the most suitable terms of engagement. If the positions were ever to move to far away from each other, the system would most likely 
		experience a strain it has not so far done, as can be witnessed by the fact that most negotiations are done rather amicably. The point 
		is rather that these factors - the nesting of calculations, the regulatory thicket, the contestedness of calculative techniques and 
		valuative processes - all have an effect on who has a say in a vital infrastructure. As such, it has a bearing on how a vital matter of 
		concern functions in the setting of a market-based democracy, and in the even wider sense, should inform our understanding of the 
		possibilities for democratic control of highly complex and interconnected systems and infrastructures.
		</p>

		<p>The liberalization of the Norwegian electricity market is often termed a deregulation, but given the immense amount of regulation 
		connected to the control of the grid companies’ income this seems to be a misnomer. Rather, we might speak of a re-regulation rather 
		than de-regulation. However, while reintroducing regulation is often hailed as a way of reinstating public control over what are deemed 
		crucial socio-technical constructions for society, the example of the kinds of documents that form the regulatory core of this system 
		would seem to imply that it would mostly be a question of handing decision-making control over to a new group of sequestered experts. 
		After all, no-one can actually follow these controversies - both due to the actual negotiations largely going on behind closed doors and 
		due to the sheer opaqueness of the calculative techniques and their documentation. There are few avenues of public engagement. These 
		sites of battle are far away from participatory democracy, even if they constitute the core of what Lamont calls ‘burning topics’ in 
		democracy.<label for="35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

		</span>

		<p>The complexity of today’s arrangement calls to mind the black-boxing of technologies so well-known from science and technology 
		studies, where the assumptions that underlie socio-technical solutions are removed from the public eye and placed in the black box. 
		In this sense, it is somewhat ironic that every part of the income calculation process for grid companies in Norway is in principle 
		in the open, with all documents obtainable from a public source (if only for a limited time frame, as with the document used as an 
		example in this article), and yet the reasoning that is embedded in these documents is still so elusive. As such, it might make more 
		sense to talk of a photochromatic box rather than a black one - it is seemingly transparent until light is shined directly on it, 
		when it turns out to be opaque after all.

	<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In this article, we have tried to discuss the importance of paying close attention to the ways in which the on-going process of 
		bringing economic reasoning to bear on what is essentially political processes can make a tiny contribution towards a deeper 
		understanding of how modern society is governed. Economisation is about a specific framing/formatting of something as economic, 
		but framing something is as much as about what is left outside the frame as what is placed in it. In the case of the Norwegian 
		electricity market, when the production side was economised, or rather re-regulated as argued above, the distribution side had to be 
		reconfigured to respond to the economization. In this sense, this can be seen as a by-product of the main economization process, an 
		indirect economization.
		</p>

		<p>The above discussion points to the obvious political nature of these supposedly depoliticised issues. Even if attempts have 
		been made to cleanse the running of the electricity system of non-economic concerns, the negotiated nature of calculations show the 
		clear implications increasing technocratisation has for the possibilities to manage large and complex technical systems in a democratic 
		fashion. Indeed, we could say that economisation itself in this case has led to an increased technocratisation. Only a handful of 
		experts will ever have access to the main guidelines that ultimately decide how much of citizens’ disposable income will have to go 
		to paying for access to electricity, never mind actually understanding how these guidelines are made and what the consequences of 
		minor changes to them are.
		</p>

		<p>Of course, it could be convincingly argued that the previous situation - engineers making their long-term marginal cost of 
		production calculations and delivering them to politicians who were not necessarily able to judge the quality of them - did not 
		exactly invite much democratic deliberation either. In fact, there has never been a situation where a central infrastructure like 
		the electricity system has not been dominated by a Weberian rational-legal authority. However, this is still not to say that rule 
		by engineers or economists is equal in nature. Regardless of how opaque the previous situation was, there was at least the possibility 
		of a political engagement due to the rounds the cost of our energy infrastructure had to make in an arena of democratic representation. 
		Members of Parliament are perhaps not equipped to have the final say in what the ‘correct’ price of electricity should be, but it 
		remains a fact that it used to make an appearance in a court of opinion every year, reminding us that the organisation of our 
		infrastructure is a political as well as a technical question.
		</p>

		<p>We would argue that the case of the economic performativity of processes of economisation of infrastructure, direct or indirect, 
		is an interesting avenue for further exploration in order to seek answers to questions of democratically legitimate decision making 
		or the reversibility of political decisions. A valuative investigation into the change process we have described in this paper would 
		be instructive in this regard, as would any attention given to sites of indirect economisation as potentially more openly contestable 
		sites of controversy.
